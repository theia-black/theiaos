# `theiaos status`

Diagnostics for channels + sessions.

```bash
theiaos status
theiaos status --all
theiaos status --deep
theiaos status --usage
```

Notes:

- `--deep` runs live probes (WhatsApp Web + Telegram + Discord + Google Chat + Slack + Signal).
- Output includes per-agent session stores when multiple agents are configured.
- Overview includes Gateway + node host service install/runtime status when available.
- Overview includes update channel + git SHA (for source checkouts).
- Update info surfaces in the Overview; if an update is available, status prints a hint to run `theiaos update` (see [Updating](/install/updating)).
